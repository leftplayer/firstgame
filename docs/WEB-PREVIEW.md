# Web preview

GitHub Pages builds the DOM preview; these UI changes apply to web, not the Cocos scene.

Chinese uses original characters, including punctuation, and supports multi-character IME commits. Preedit starts the clock immediately when the browser receives a keystroke / insertion / composition update; validation waits for committed Chinese text. English preedit still updates immediately.

Incorrect characters remain in the input and are highlighted red in the original text. Later characters continue advancing normally. No error message is shown. Completion still requires correcting all mismatches.

The viewport contains five lines. Row one stays at the top initially; afterward one previous row is retained so the active row stays second. Lower rows fade and blur. Result timer uses smaller typography.

Run `npm test` and `node scripts/build-web.mjs`. Mobile native IME behavior still needs real-device verification.
